# Terms of Service

## Using WoW Lab

WoW Lab is a free, community-run simulator for World of Warcraft. It's for personal, non-commercial use. We are not affiliated with Blizzard Entertainment.

## No warranties

The service is as-is and as-available. We do not promise uptime, accuracy, fitness for a purpose, or error-free results. Check results before you rely on them.

## Accounts and access

Sign-in uses third-party OAuth providers like [Discord](https://discord.com) or [GitHub](https://github.com). We may suspend or block access for abuse, security issues, or legal reasons.

## Content you share

You're responsible for rotations or other material you publish. You let us host and display it inside the service.

## Acceptable use

- Don't attack, scrape, or overload the service.
- Don't try to bypass security or abuse authentication.
- Don't upload illegal or malicious content.

## Liability

This is a free service without liability. If it's unavailable, inaccurate, or causes loss, you use it at your own risk and we're not responsible.

## Changes

We may update these terms. When changes are material, we'll update the date and, when reasonable, call out the changes in the app.
