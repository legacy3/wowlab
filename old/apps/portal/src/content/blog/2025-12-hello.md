# Hello!

Welcome to WoW Lab! This is the first post on our blog, and we're excited to share what we've been building.

## What is this?

WoW Lab is a combat simulation platform for World of Warcraft. You can run sims in your browser, write custom rotation scripts, and query game data through our MCP server.

This is **version 0.1.0** - very much a work in progress. Things will break, features are incomplete, and we're iterating fast. But we wanted to get something out there and start building in public.

## What's next?

Real news coming soon. We'll use this blog to share updates, guides, and announcements as we build out the platform.

In the meantime:

- Check out the [About](/about) page to learn more about what WoW Lab is and how it works
- See which specs are ready to sim on the [Spec Coverage](/lab/spec-coverage) page
- Join our [Discord](/go/discord) to chat, ask questions, or share feedback

Thanks for stopping by!
