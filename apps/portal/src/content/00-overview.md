# WoWLab

A combat simulation platform for World of Warcraft. Run sims, write rotation scripts, and query game data.

## What you can do

**Run simulations** in the browser. Test rotations and compare builds, no install required.

**Write rotation scripts** to customize decision logic. Match your playstyle or theorycraft new approaches.

**Query game data** with the MCP server. Any tool (Claude, Cursor, your own scripts) can pull spell and item data from WoW's DBC files.

## Getting started

### Run a simulation

1. Open the portal
2. Select a spec and gear profile
3. Hit run and see results

### Customize a rotation

Rotation scripts define what abilities to use and when. Start by copying an existing script and tweaking the priority logic.

### Query WoW data

The [MCP Server](/docs/01-mcp-server) exposes WoW spell/item data to AI assistants and other tools. Useful for theorycrafting, building tools, or just looking up game mechanics.
