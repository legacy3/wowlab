# Hello!

Welcome to WoW Lab! This is our first blog post. Here's what we've been building.

## What is this?

WoW Lab is a combat simulation platform for World of Warcraft. You can build rotations in the browser, run simulations on your local machine, and query game data through Supabase.

This is **version 0.1.0** - very much a work in progress. Things will break, features are incomplete, and we're iterating fast. We want to build in public.

## What's next?

More news soon. This blog covers updates, guides, and announcements as we build the platform.

In the meantime:

- Check out the [About](/about) page to learn more about what WoW Lab is and how it works
- See which specs are ready to sim on the [Spec Coverage](/dev/docs/guides/01-spec-coverage) page
- Join our [Discord](/go/discord) to chat, ask questions, or share feedback

Thanks for stopping by!
