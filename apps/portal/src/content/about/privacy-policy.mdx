## How we use data

We use the data above to sign you in, show your profile, save rotations and settings, and protect the service from abuse.

## Sharing

WoW Lab runs on Supabase; their systems process and store this data. For details on their handling, read the [Supabase Privacy Notice](https://supabase.com/privacy).

## Retention and deletion

Delete your account any time in account settings. This is irreversible and removes your WoW Lab account and metadata immediately. Supabase may retain minimal operational logs under their policies. Deleting your account may make public content you created (shared rotations, for example) inaccessible.

## Cookies and local storage

Supabase auth uses cookies to keep you signed in. We also keep small client-side caches (React Query) to speed up loading.
