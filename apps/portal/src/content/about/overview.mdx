## What it is

WoW Lab is a free combat simulator for World of Warcraft. Test rotations, compare gear, and theorycraft without guessing.

It's a love letter to the WoW theorycrafting community - the people who dig into spell data, reverse-engineer mechanics, and share what they learn so everyone can play better.

## How it works

1. Build a rotation in the [rotation editor](/rotations/editor)
2. Run a node on your PC (or share one with your guild)
3. Simulate and see results

Your hardware runs the simulations. The website just coordinates.

## Open source

Everything is on [GitHub](/go/github). Free forever.
