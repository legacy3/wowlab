## What it is

WoW Lab is a free combat simulator for World of Warcraft. Test rotations, compare gear, and theorycraft without guessing.

It's a love letter to the WoW theorycrafting community. The people who dig into spell data, reverse-engineer mechanics, and share what they learn so everyone can play better.

## How it works

<Steps>
  <Step step={1} title="Build a rotation">
    Use the [rotation editor](/rotations/editor) to define your priority list.
  </Step>
  <Step step={2} title="Run a node">
    Start a node on your PC (or share one with your guild).
  </Step>
  <Step step={3} title="Simulate and see results">
    Your hardware runs the simulations. The website just coordinates.
  </Step>
