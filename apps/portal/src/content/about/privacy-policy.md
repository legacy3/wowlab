## How we use data

We use the data above to sign you in, show your profile, save/render rotations and settings, and protect the service from abuse.

## Sharing

WoW Lab runs on Supabase; their systems process and store this data. For details on their handling, read the [Supabase Privacy Notice](https://supabase.com/privacy).

## Retention and deletion

Delete your account any time in [account settings](/account/settings). This is irreversible and removes your WoW Lab account and metadata immediately. Supabase may retain minimal operational logs under their policies, which we do not control. Deleting your account may make public content you created (for example, shared rotations) inaccessible.

## Cookies and local storage

Supabase auth uses cookies to keep you signed in. We also keep small client-side caches to speed up loading; see the caching notes in the [Data Model docs](/docs/reference/01-data-model) for more detail on what’s stored locally.
