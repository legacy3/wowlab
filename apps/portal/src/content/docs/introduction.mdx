# WoW Lab

Combat simulation platform for World of Warcraft. Build rotations in your browser, run sims on your machine, query game data through MCP.

## Quick links

- [Quickstart](/dev/docs/00-getting-started/00-quickstart) - Run your first sim
- [Rotation Basics](/dev/docs/01-rotations/00-basics) - Learn priority lists
- [Spec Coverage](/dev/docs/03-data/02-spec-coverage) - See what specs work

## How it works

1. **Build** - Create rotation priority lists in the visual editor
2. **Simulate** - Run thousands of iterations on your local machine
3. **Analyze** - View DPS distributions, damage breakdowns, and timelines

The browser handles rotation building and results display. A local node runs the actual simulation using a JIT-compiled Rust engine.
