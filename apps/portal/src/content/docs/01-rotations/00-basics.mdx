# Rotation Basics

Rotations are priority lists. The engine checks each action from top to bottom, casting the first one whose conditions pass.

## The mental model

Think of a rotation as a series of questions:

1. Should I cast Bestial Wrath? (Check: is it off cooldown?)
2. Should I cast Barbed Shot? (Check: is it off cooldown?)
3. Should I cast Kill Command? (Check: is it off cooldown?)
4. Should I cast Cobra Shot? (No condition, always yes)

The engine asks these questions every time the GCD ends. The first "yes" wins.

## Priority order matters

Put your most important abilities at the top. The engine stops checking once something casts.

Bad order:

1. Cobra Shot (filler, always casts)
2. Kill Command (never reached)

Good order:

1. Kill Command (casts when ready)
2. Cobra Shot (fills when Kill Command is on cooldown)

## Conditions

Conditions determine when an action can execute. Common patterns:

**Cooldown ready:**

```
cd.bestial_wrath.ready
```

**Resource threshold:**

```
focus.current >= 50
```

**Buff active:**

```
buff.bestial_wrath.active
```

**Combined:**

```
cd.kill_command.ready & focus.current >= 30
```

## No condition = always

An action without a condition always executes when reached. Use this for fillers at the bottom of your list.

## The simulation loop

Every GCD:

1. Engine checks action 1 condition
2. If true, cast spell, done
3. If false, check action 2 condition
4. Repeat until something casts

If nothing casts, the engine waits for the next event (cooldown ready, resource tick, etc.).

## Example rotation

BM Hunter single target:

| Priority | Action        | Condition                     |
| -------- | ------------- | ----------------------------- |
| 1        | Bestial Wrath | `cd.bestial_wrath.ready`      |
| 2        | Barbed Shot   | `cd.barbed_shot.charges >= 1` |
| 3        | Kill Command  | `cd.kill_command.ready`       |
| 4        | Dire Beast    | `cd.dire_beast.ready`         |
| 5        | Cobra Shot    | (none)                        |
