# Editor Guide

The rotation editor at [/01-rotations/editor](/01-rotations/editor) provides a visual interface for building rotations.

## Creating a rotation

1. Click "New Rotation"
2. Select your class and spec
3. Name your rotation

## Adding actions

Click "Add Action" to add a new priority entry. Choose the action type:

- **Cast** - Use a spell
- **Call** - Jump to a named list, return if nothing casts
- **Run** - Jump to a named list, continue regardless
- **Wait** - Pause for a duration
- **Pool** - Wait for resources

## Setting conditions

Click the condition field to open the condition builder. Options:

**Visual mode** - Click to build conditions from dropdowns

**Text mode** - Type conditions directly using expression syntax

The editor validates conditions against your spec. Invalid spell names or syntax errors show immediately.

## Reordering

Drag actions to reorder priorities. Remember: higher = more important.

## Named lists

For complex rotations, break logic into named lists:

1. Click "Add List"
2. Name it (e.g., "cooldowns", "aoe", "cleave")
3. Add actions to the list
4. Reference with Call or Run from main actions

Use Call when the list should return control (cooldown checks). Use Run when the list handles the rest of the GCD (AoE rotation).

## Testing

Click "Validate" to check your rotation against the engine. The validator reports:

- Unknown spell names
- Invalid conditions
- Syntax errors

## Saving

Click "Save" to store the rotation. You get:

- A unique URL for sharing
- Version history
- The ability to fork and modify

## Importing/Exporting

**Export** - Download rotation as JSON for backup or sharing

**Import** - Upload a JSON file to create a rotation

The JSON format matches the [JSON Format](/dev/docs/01-rotations/02-json-format) reference.
