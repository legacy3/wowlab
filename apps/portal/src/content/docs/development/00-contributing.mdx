# Contributing

Want to hack on WoW Lab? Here is how to get set up.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- pnpm 10+

## Setup

Clone the repo and install deps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/legacy3/wowlab.git
cd wowlab
pnpm install
```

## Environment

Copy `apps/portal/.env.example` to `.env.local`.

## Commands

```bash
pnpm build    # compile everything
pnpm dev      # run the portal locally
pnpm test     # run tests
pnpm lint     # check for lint errors
```

## Code style

The simulation engine is written in Rust (see `crates/engine/`). The portal is a Next.js app using React Query for data fetching and Zustand for local state. WASM is used for type sharing and rotation validation in the browser.

## Editing docs

Docs live in `apps/portal/src/content/docs/`. Just add MDX files and they will be picked up automatically by Velite.
