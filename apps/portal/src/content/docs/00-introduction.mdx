# Introduction

WowLab is a distributed simulation engine for World of Warcraft theorycrafting. It combines a high-performance Rust-based simulation core with a horizontally scalable network infrastructure to enable large-scale statistical analysis of combat mechanics.

## Overview

The system consists of three primary components:

1. **Simulation Engine** - A deterministic Rust engine compiled to WebAssembly for browser execution and native binaries for distributed compute nodes
2. **Distributed Network** - A realtime infrastructure using Centrifugo for WebSocket communication and Redis for coordination
3. **Portal Application** - A Next.js web application providing the user interface for character planning, rotation editing, and simulation analysis

## Documentation Structure

This documentation covers the technical architecture and implementation details of the WowLab platform:

## Citation System

This documentation uses academic-style citations to reference external sources. Inline citations appear as superscript links. For example, the <Cite id="websocket" s="4.1">WebSocket protocol</Cite> enables full-duplex communication between clients and servers.

All referenced sources are listed on the [References](/dev/docs/references) page.
