# Spec Coverage

The [spec coverage tool](/lab/spec-coverage) shows which spells are currently supported by the simulator.

## When to use it

Wondering if a spec is ready to sim? Check here first. You will see which abilities the simulator knows about before you spend time writing rotations.

## How it works

The tool queries spell data for implemented specs and compares it against the spells the simulator knows how to process. The data is generated dynamically from the current patch, so it stays up to date as new spells are added.

## What you see

After loading, you get four views:

- **Overall coverage** - The big picture scorecard across all specs
- **Per-class breakdown** - How each class stacks up
- **Coverage matrix** - A color-coded grid of every spec at a glance
- **Untracked spells** - Handlers referencing spell IDs not found in DBC data

Click any spec to see exactly which spells are supported and which are missing.

## Coverage levels

The matrix uses color coding to indicate coverage:

| Color       | Coverage |
| ----------- | -------- |
| Red         | 0-30%    |
| Orange      | 30-50%   |
| Yellow      | 50-70%   |
| Light green | 70-90%   |
| Green       | 90%+     |

## Interpreting results

High coverage means most of the spec's abilities are implemented. Low coverage means the spec may not simulate accurately yet.

Keep in mind that coverage percentage alone doesn't tell the whole story. A spec might have high coverage but still be missing a key rotational ability.
