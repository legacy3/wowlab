# Running a Node

Simulations run on local nodes, not in the browser. The Rust engine uses JIT compilation which browsers cannot support.

## Quick start

```bash
npx @wowlab/node
```

The node:

1. Connects to the WoW Lab platform
2. Receives simulation jobs
3. Runs the Rust engine locally
4. Returns results to the browser

## Why local nodes?

Browsers cannot JIT-compile arbitrary code. The simulation engine compiles rotations to native machine code using Cranelift for maximum performance. This requires running outside the browser sandbox.

Benefits:

- Your hardware runs the math
- No server costs
- Full CPU utilization
- Privacy (simulation data stays local)

## Configuration

Environment variables:

| Variable         | Default   | Description                          |
| ---------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `WOWLAB_THREADS` | CPU count | Worker thread count                  |
| `WOWLAB_LOG`     | `info`    | Log level (debug, info, warn, error) |

Example:

```bash
WOWLAB_THREADS=4 WOWLAB_LOG=debug npx @wowlab/node
```

## Docker

Run the node in a container:

```bash
docker run -it ghcr.io/legacy3/wowlab-node
```

## Building from source

Clone and build the Rust engine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/legacy3/wowlab.git
cd wowlab/crates/engine
cargo build --release
./target/release/wowlab-node
```
