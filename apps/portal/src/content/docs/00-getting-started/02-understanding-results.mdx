# Understanding Results

Simulations run many iterations to produce statistical results. Here's how to read them.

## Key metrics

### Mean DPS

Average damage per second across all iterations. This is your expected DPS if you play the rotation perfectly with average luck.

### Standard deviation

How much DPS varies between iterations. High std dev means RNG-heavy specs (lots of procs). Low std dev means consistent damage.

### Percentiles

- **10th percentile** - Bad luck scenario (10% of runs are worse)
- **50th percentile** - Median result
- **90th percentile** - Good luck scenario (10% of runs are better)

The gap between 10th and 90th shows how much RNG affects your spec.

## Damage breakdown

Per-spell contribution to total damage:

| Spell        | Damage    | % Total | DPS   |
| ------------ | --------- | ------- | ----- |
| Kill Command | 1,234,567 | 25.3%   | 4,115 |
| Barbed Shot  | 987,654   | 20.1%   | 3,292 |
| ...          | ...       | ...     | ...   |

Use this to identify:

- Which abilities matter most
- Whether cooldowns align correctly
- If filler is casting too much/little

## Iteration count

More iterations = more accurate results.

| Iterations | Accuracy  | Use case           |
| ---------- | --------- | ------------------ |
| 100        | Low       | Quick testing      |
| 1,000      | Medium    | General use        |
| 10,000     | High      | Final comparisons  |
| 100,000    | Very high | Publishing results |

Rule of thumb: if changing iterations changes your mean DPS by more than 0.5%, run more iterations.

## Fight duration

Longer fights smooth out cooldown alignment RNG. Shorter fights amplify opener strength.

- **60s** - Mythic+ pack, execute-heavy
- **180s** - Short boss, 2-3 cooldown uses
- **300s** - Standard Patchwerk, 5+ cooldown uses
- **480s** - Long boss, better statistical average

## Comparing results

When comparing two setups:

1. Use the same iteration count
2. Use the same fight duration
3. Look at confidence intervals, not just means

A 500 DPS difference with 10,000 iterations is significant. The same difference with 100 iterations might be noise.
