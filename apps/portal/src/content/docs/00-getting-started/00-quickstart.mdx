# Quickstart

Run a simulation from start to finish.

## 1. Open the rotation editor

Go to [/01-rotations/editor](/01-rotations/editor) and select your spec.

## 2. Build a rotation

Add actions to the priority list. The engine evaluates top to bottom, casting the first spell whose conditions pass.

Example BM Hunter rotation:

1. Cast Bestial Wrath if ready
2. Cast Barbed Shot if ready
3. Cast Kill Command if ready
4. Cast Cobra Shot (filler)

Set conditions using the condition builder or type them directly.

## 3. Save the rotation

Click Save. The rotation stores in the database and generates a shareable link.

## 4. Start a local node

Download the WoW Lab node app for your platform from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/legacy3/wowlab/releases). Run the app and you'll see a claim code like `XXXX-XXXX`.

Go to [wowlab.gg/nodes](https://wowlab.gg/nodes) and enter the code to link the node to your account. The node connects to the platform and waits for simulation jobs.

## 5. Run the simulation

Back in the browser, click Simulate. Configure:

- **Duration** - Fight length (default: 300s)
- **Iterations** - Number of runs (default: 1000)
- **Targets** - Enemy count

Click Run. The job dispatches to your local node.

## 6. View results

Results appear when the simulation completes:

- **Mean DPS** - Average damage per second
- **Std Dev** - Variance between iterations
- **Percentiles** - 10th, 50th, 90th percentile DPS
- **Damage Breakdown** - Per-spell contribution
